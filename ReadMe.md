This is a game system for roleplaying as cats in Second Life, as cats. It is a work in progress, and is not yet ready for use.

It is currently tailored for the Maneki Neko avatar.

OpenSimulator support is planned, but not yet implemented.

Documentation is available in the Documentation folder of this repository. It will be moved to the Wiki for tidiness at a later date.
